# Project Description
**Part 2 Multi-Container Application Deployment using Docker Compose:** In this project, I will be deploying a multi-container application using Docker Compose. The application will consist of two containers - one container running a `web application` and the other container running a `database`.

**1. First I created the network `my_network` as you can see in the image below. The `docker network ls` is showing the newly created network.**
